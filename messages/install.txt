##Sphere Online Judge 

Thanks for installing the Sphere Online Judge Sublime Plugin!

This plugin is used for displaying Sphere Online Judge problem contents in a textarea in Sublime Text so that problems can be read and coded together at the same time!

Usage:

You can click on the Tools Menu, then Sphere Online Judge-> Respective Options
The Command Pallete also has these options.

The first option, reads the first 5 lines of your current opened file for a problem id. The probem ID is used by Sphere Online Judge for submissions and serving content.

For example, the prime generator problem's URL is : http://www.spoj.com/problems/PRIME1/
and here the problem ID is PRIME1

You can declare the problem ID in your codefile as a docstring parameter.

In Python, you can do:
"""
@problem: PRIME1
"""
In java, C, C++
/*
* @problem: PRIME1
*/

If the plugin can't find the ID, it will automatically prompt you for the ID.

The second option does the same, it just does not check the view for the ID and implicitly asks you for the ID.

Thanks for using, and feel free to fork, star and watch the repo on github at https://github.com/geekpradd/Sphere-Online-Judge-Sublime.
